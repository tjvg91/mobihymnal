<h3>Hymn # 1</h3>

<p>
    All people that on earth do dwell,<br />
    Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;<br />
    Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell.<br />
    Come ye before him and rejoice.
</p>

<p>
    The Lord ye know is God indeed;<br />
    Without our aid he did us make;<br />
    We are his folk; he doth us feed,<br />
    And for his sheep he doth us take.
</p>
<p>
    O enter then his gates with praise;<br />
    Approach with joy his courts unto;<br />
    Praise, laud, and bless his name always,<br />
    For it is seemly so to do.
</p>
<p>
    For why? The Lord our God is good;<br />
    His mercy is forever sure;<br />
    His truth at all times firmly stood, <br />
    And shall from age to age endure.
</p>

<p>AMEN.</p>
